Here’s a reusable, detailed prompt you can paste into Replit AI (or any coding agent) to generate guided WhatsApp journeys for your elder-learning platform.

Prompt for Replit AI: Build Senior-Friendly WhatsApp Guided Journeys
You are an expert full‑stack developer and UX designer building a web‑based “guided help” module for an elder-learning platform. The goal is to create simple, step‑by‑step WhatsApp walkthroughs for seniors (70+) that can be read on the web or inside a web‑view, and optionally mirrored as WhatsApp messages from a bot.

1. Project Goal
Build a small web app (HTML/CSS/JS, no backend required for v1) that shows guided scripts for common WhatsApp tasks for seniors:

Open WhatsApp and read a message

Send a simple text message

Send a photo (new + existing)

Make a video call

Join and behave safely in a family group

Turn on basic privacy protections

Leave a group that feels uncomfortable

Each “guide” should be shown as a wizard‑like sequence of very clear steps, one per screen/row, with Previous / Next controls, and large readable UI.

Use evidence-based mobile design guidelines for older adults (large touch targets, simple layout, low cognitive load, high contrast, minimal options on screen).
​

2. Target Users and Constraints
Design for:

Age: 70+

Likely vision issues → need large text (at least 18–20px), high contrast.
​

Possible tremor / arthritis → large buttons, generous spacing, avoid small tap targets.
​

Low digital confidence → very clear, plain language, one idea per step, no jargon.
​

Assume:

They are using Android or iOS with WhatsApp.

They are reading this guide in a browser on tablet or phone.

A caregiver may sit next to them and read aloud.

3. UX Requirements
Implement a single-page web app with:

A simple top bar with the platform name, e.g. “Elder Learn – WhatsApp Guides”.

A left column (or top selector on mobile) listing the journeys:

“1. Read a message”

“2. Send a text”

“3. Send a photo”

“4. Video call”

“5. Family groups & safety”

“6. Privacy settings”

“7. Leave a group”

A main panel that shows one guide at a time as a stepper:

A big title: e.g. “Send a simple text message”.

A prominent Step X of Y indicator.

The current step text in short sentences, max 2 short sentences per step.

Below the text, optional small “Trainer notes” line (for caregivers).

Navigation buttons: “Back” and a highlighted “Next” (or “Finish” on last step).

A very simple design:

Large font (18–20px body, 22–26px titles).

High contrast: dark text on light background, large buttons with clear labels.
​

Big click/tap area (minimum 44x44px for buttons and step selectors).
​

No complex animations; keep everything calm and predictable.

4. Content for Each Journey
Use these exact user-facing steps, but you may slightly tweak wording for brevity, not complexity. Keep them extremely simple.

Journey 1: Read a message
Steps (each step is one screen in the wizard):

Find the WhatsApp icon on your home screen. It is green with a white telephone. Tap it once.

You are now on Chats. This is your list of conversations.

Look for the person’s name. If you see a small number or dot next to it, there is a new message.

Tap their name once.

New messages are at the bottom of the screen. Slide your finger up to see older messages.

Tap the back arrow at the top‑left to return to the list of chats.

Journey 2: Send a simple text
Open WhatsApp and go to Chats.

To reply, tap the person’s name. To start a new chat, tap the green message/plus button, then tap the person’s name.

At the bottom, tap the long white box. The keyboard appears.

Type a short message, for example: “Hello, I can see your message.”

Tap the green send arrow or paper airplane.

Your message appears on the right side of the screen. That means it was sent.

Journey 3: Send a photo
A. Take and send a new photo

Open the chat with the person.

Tap the paperclip or plus (+) next to the typing box.

Tap Camera.

Point the camera and tap the big round button to take the picture.

If you like the photo, tap the green Send arrow. If not, tap X or Back and try again.

B. Send a photo from Gallery

Tap the paperclip/plus again.

Tap Gallery or Photos.

Tap the picture you want.

Tap Send.

Journey 4: Video call
Open WhatsApp and go to Chats.

Tap the name of the person you want to see.

At the top‑right, tap the video camera icon.

Wait while it rings. You will see your face on the screen.

When they answer, you will both see each other. Speak normally.

To end the call, tap the red phone button.

Journey 5: Family groups & safety
On Chats, group conversations show more than one person. Tap the group name.

Anything you write in this group is seen by everyone in the group.

Use the typing box and send button like a normal chat.

Do not share personal details like ID numbers, bank details, or passwords.

Be careful with links that talk about prizes or special offers. Ask family before tapping.

If someone in the group makes you uncomfortable, tell a family member or helper.

Journey 6: Turn on privacy settings
(Trainer can guide; steps still senior-friendly.)

In WhatsApp, tap the three dots (top‑right), then tap Settings. On iPhone, tap Settings at the bottom.

Tap Privacy.

Tap Profile photo and choose My contacts.

Tap Last seen and online and choose My contacts or Nobody.

Tap Groups and choose My contacts so only your contacts can add you to groups.

If unknown numbers bother you, turn on Silence unknown callers (if available).

Journey 7: Leave a group
Open the group you want to leave.

Tap the group’s name at the top.

Scroll to the bottom. Tap Exit group.

Tap Exit again to confirm.

You will no longer get messages from that group.

5. Implementation Details
Stack:

HTML + CSS + vanilla JS is enough.

Organize content as a simple JSON structure: an array of journeys, each with title, description, and steps.

JS behavior:

When user clicks a journey in the list, load its steps and reset to step 1.

“Next” moves forward unless on last step; then it can show “Finished!” message or loop back.

“Back” disabled on first step.

Store current journey + step in memory; optional: use localStorage so seniors can come back to where they left.

Accessibility:

Use proper semantic HTML (buttons, headings).

Large fonts, high contrast, focus states for keyboard.

Avoid more than ~8–9 steps per journey; if more, break into sections.
​

6. Optional: Design for Future WhatsApp Bot Integration
Structure the data so that later the same JSON can drive:

The web stepper UI, and

A WhatsApp “coach bot” that sends the same steps as messages (one step per message, asking “Type NEXT when you are ready.”).

So:

Put the journeys in a JSON object with keys: id, title, steps, and trainerNotes (optional).

Keep each step as short text, suitable for sending as a single WhatsApp message.

7. What to Output
A single Replit project structure with:

index.html

style.css

script.js

data.js (or embedded JSON) for the guides.

Fully working code that:

Renders the list of journeys.

Renders the stepper UI.

Allows navigation between journeys and steps.

Brief explanation in comments of:

Where to edit/add new journeys.

How to adjust fonts/colors for accessibility.

Start by generating all four files with clean, readable code and then explain how to run it on Replit.

Use this prompt as-is with Replit AI. If you need, the next step can be: “Refine the color palette and typography to WCAG AA contrast for seniors.”
